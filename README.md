Game Title: ScaredMan

Genre: Action / Horror / Roguelike

Description:
In ScaredMan, you step into the trembling shoes of a nerdy, anxiety-ridden man cursed with an uncontrollable, primal rage. 
Haunted by his fears and pushed to his limits, he teeters between terrified survival and monstrous destruction. 
When fear overwhelms him, he snaps—unleashing inhuman strength and going berserk on anything in his way.

Navigate eerie environments, solve tense puzzles, and manage your fear levels carefully. Stay scared too long, and you’ll lose control, turning into an unstoppable force of chaos.
But be warned—while your berserk state grants immense power, it also blurs reality, making friend and foe indistinguishable. Will you conquer your fears or become the nightmare yourself?
